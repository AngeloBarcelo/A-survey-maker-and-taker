Everything from what is displayed to the survey taker, the validation loops, number of respondents, number of questions, and highest answer allowed are based on those variables. None of the numbers are hard coded into the program. This was done to make the program much more maintainable and avoid the need to read through all the code and change all variables associated with the limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
